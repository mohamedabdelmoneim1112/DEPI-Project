## Objectives  
- Automate fish/shrimp **counting** and **biomass estimation**.  
- Monitor **feeding behavior** and optimize feed management.  
- Detect **abnormal swimming patterns, stress, or diseases** early.  
- Provide **data-driven dashboards** for decision-making using SQL, Python, and Power BI.  
- Support **sustainable aquaculture practices** by reducing waste and improving efficiency.
