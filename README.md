# 🌍 Global Fisheries & Aquaculture Production Analytics  
### **FAO Historical Data Analysis Project**

---

## 📘 Project Overview  
This project analyzes decades of FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) global fisheries and aquaculture data. It provides a comprehensive, data-driven view of fish production across all countries using **Power BI**.

The analysis covers four major production sources:

- **Capture Fisheries (Wild Catch)**
- **Freshwater Aquaculture**
- **Marine Aquaculture**
- **Brackish Water Aquaculture**

The project also explores fish species distribution, country-specific production trends, and long-term historical patterns across different time periods.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze global fish production trends across countries and regions.  
- Compare production from wild catch vs. the three aquaculture types.  
- Identify growth periods, declines, and historical turning points across decades.  
- Explore species composition for each country and production system.  
- Provide interactive dashboards for policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders.  
- Support better planning toward sustainable aquaculture development.
