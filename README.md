# AI-Powered Underwater Monitoring System for Aquaculture  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project develops an **AI-powered underwater camera system** designed to enhance monitoring and management in aquaculture.  
By combining **Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Data Analytics**, the system provides real-time insights into fish and shrimp farming operations.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Automate fish/shrimp **counting** and **biomass estimation**.  
- Monitor **feeding behavior** and optimize feed management.  
- Detect **abnormal swimming patterns, stress, or diseases** early.  
- Provide **data-driven dashboards** for decision-making using SQL, Python, and Power BI.  
- Support **sustainable aquaculture practices** by reducing waste and improving efficiency.  

---

## ⚙️ Features  
- **Underwater camera integration** with live data streaming.  
- **AI models** for object detection and behavior analysis.  
- **Data pipeline** (Python + SQL) to store and process results.  
- **Visualization dashboard** (Power BI) for real-time monitoring.  
- Modular design for scalability across small and large aquaculture farms.
